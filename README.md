# Creating Malware Using Python

  <h1>In this project, I embarked on a simulated malware creation journey using Python. Here's what I did:</h1> 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Setting Up the Environment:</h4>I started by creating a directory named "fake_malware" and added three files within it: "fake_malware.py," "passwords.txt," and "very_important_file.txt." These were filled with random text for testing purposes.
	
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Malware Script Development:</h4> Within "fake_malware.py," I imported the os library and initialized an empty list called 'files' to store filenames.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>File Handling and Filtering:</h4> Employing a loop to iterate through the directory's files, I ensured the exclusion of the script itself from encryption. I collected filenames (excluding directories) into the 'files' list.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Encryption Setup:</h4> Importing the 'Fernet' library from 'cryptography.fernet', I generated a key and saved it to "secretkey.key" for future decryption. It was essential to prevent the key file from being encrypted.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>File Encryption:</h4> Employing a loop, I encrypted files using Fernet encryption with the generated key. This ensured that their content was encrypted and updated accordingly.
	
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Decryption Setup:</h4> I created another script ("fake_decrypt.py") by copying the malware script and modified it to focus on decryption. I retrieved the key from "secretkey.key" to facilitate file decryption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>File Decryption:</h4> The modified script allowed me to decrypt files, restoring them to their original state using the obtained key.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Adding Ransomware Messages:</h4> To simulate ransomware behavior, I included a ransom-like message in the malware script, indicating file encryption. In the decrypt script, I added a passphrase requirement to unlock the files post-decryption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Learning Outcomes:</h4> Throughout this project, I gained invaluable insights into file handling, encryption, and decryption processes using Python. Understanding how ransomware operates and how encryption works enhanced my knowledge of cybersecurity measures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project underscored the importance of ethical considerations in handling such tools and knowledge. It served as a reminder of the potential dangers of malware and the significance of robust cybersecurity practices.
